**Work:**
I'm currently a Lead ADAS Controls Engineer at Ford since February 2022. Before that, I worked in software and powertrain engineering at Horiba Automotive Test Systems and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. I'm also the co-founder of MeruDynamics.

**Education:** I finished my MS in the Mechanical Engineering at Michigan Technological  University in 2013. In my thesis I developed and applied probabilistic machine learning methods to biomedical applications. See more about my research in the Projects page.

**Open knowledge:** On my spare time I have been working on minimum viable product for my ideas.

**Hobbies:** Reading, trekking, kite flying, cross-fit, cycling.

**Summary of my life philosophy**
•	Life is about solving problems; obstacles are the way forward.
•	Make improvements, not excuses.
•	Self-care comes first—health is essential for happiness.
•	Life is short; do what brings out the best in you.
•	Always question your assumptions.
•	Effort matters more than talent.
•	Commitment and perseverance will take you far.
