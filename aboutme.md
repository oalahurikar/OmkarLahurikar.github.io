**Work:** Since August 2016, I have been working as a software and application engineer at Horiba Automotive Test Systems. Prior to that, I have worked as a power train integration engineer at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (2013-2016).

**Education:** I finished my MS in the Mechanical Engineering at Michigan Technological  University in 2013. In my thesis I developed and applied probabilistic machine learning methods to biomedical applications. See more about my research in the Projects page.

**Open knowledge:** On my spare time I have been working on minimum viable product for my ideas.
Playing with arduino and python. See more at the Projects page.

**Hobbies:** Ultimate reading, trekking, kite flying, photography, cycling.

**Summary of my life philosophy**
1. Life is about solving problems, and every obstacle is the way forward.
1. Make improvements, not excuses.
1. Self-care comes first. If you’re not healthy, it’s tough to be happy.
1. Life is short. Do what brings out the best in you.
1. Question your assumptions at all times.
1. Effort matters more than skill or talent.
1. Commitment, resilience, and perseverance will take you far.
