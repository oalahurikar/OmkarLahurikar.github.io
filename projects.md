Have a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/oalahurikar?tab=repositories)

You could find for example:

   - [Lane Lines Detection](https://github.com/oalahurikar/Advance-Lane-Lines) Uses open CV and constitutional neural network to detect road lane lines.
   - [Position estimation of moving pedestrian](https://github.com/oalahurikar/Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) Extended Kalman filter to estimate the position and velocity of pedestrian using lidar and radar sensor data.
