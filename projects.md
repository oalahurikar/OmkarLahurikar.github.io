## AI projects
 - [Road Lane Lines Detection](https://github.com/oalahurikar/Advance-Lane-Lines) Using open CV and convolution neural network (CNN) to detect road lane lines.
 - [Traffic sign identification](https://github.com/oalahurikar/Self-Driving/tree/master/Term1/2.%20Traffic%20Sign%20Classifier)  Identify road Traffic Sign using computer vision and convolutional neural network.
- [Behavioural Cloning Applied to Self-Driving Car on a Simulated Track](https://github.com/oalahurikar/Self-Driving/tree/master/Term1/3.%20Behaviorial%20Cloning) , Clone and capture human driving behavior, to train CNN. 

## Embedded projects
- [Position estimation of moving pedestrian](https://github.com/oalahurikar/Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) Extended Kalman filter used for sensor fusion to estimate the position and velocity of pedestrian using lidar and radar sensor data.
- [Indoor connected farming prototype with IOT](https://github.com/oalahurikar/Farming/tree/master) Used closed environment to optimize plant growth, used sensors to measure environment variables.
