Single Agent vs. Multiple Agents in Flow Architecture

Single Agent:

	•	Pros:
	•	Simplicity in design and implementation.
	•	Easier to manage and maintain initially.
	•	Reduced overhead in communication between components.
	•	Cons:
	•	Less modular; harder to scale specific functionalities.
	•	Potential bottleneck if the agent handles too many tasks.

Multiple Agents (Flow Architecture):

	•	Pros:
	•	Modular design; each agent handles specific tasks.
	•	Improved scalability; you can scale agents independently.
	•	Enhanced maintainability; updates to one agent won’t affect others.
	•	Cons:
	•	Increased complexity in orchestrating agents.
	•	Requires robust inter-agent communication mechanisms.
