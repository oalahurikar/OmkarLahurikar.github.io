Model based design approach is the way to define physical system in the form of mathematical equations. MBD can be accelerated using tools and software, which uses mathematical, blocks i.e. Simulink, Labview.

Blocks represent basic mathematical operations. When you connect blocks together, the resulting diagram is equivalent to the mathematical model, or representation, of the system under design.

In MBD a model is a description of a system using mathematical equations. Model may help to explain a system behavior under external excitation.

MBD can be use in all development stages like Research, Design, Implementation and Verification and Validation. It helps engineer to rapidly iterate and optimize system under development and test new ideas.

**Current popular Modeling tools can be used are.**
1. Text based:
- Python, Matlab
1. Block based:
- Simulink, SimulationX, Modelica, Labview, Amesim, NX mechatronics concept designer
