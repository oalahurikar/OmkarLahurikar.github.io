AI agents or AI in flow engineering is nothing but a system.
All variations are **agentic systems**, but draw an important architectural distinction between **workflows** and **agents**:

- **Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
- **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.
