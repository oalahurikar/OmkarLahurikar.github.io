**Physics based model:** This approach consists of building a model from physical

laws.

Physics based model is not suitable when system is complex, an incomplete

knowledge of the system structure or due to an unpredictable variation of its

features

  

**Data driven model Or Transfer function:**

This method consists of analyzing the system based on the study of its output signals in front of a well-known set of input signals.

  

**Combination of both approaches**
